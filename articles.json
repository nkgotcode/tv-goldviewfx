    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nPrice is showing rejection at 4507, just below the top of the channel. This move has also left a large-range body close gap at the 4605 Axis level.\n\nWe are now seeing a rejection test into 4320 Goldturn support, which aligns with the channel midline. A reaction is expected at this level.\nA EMA5 lock below 4320 would open the range to the downside.\nFailure to lock below this level would likely result in a bounce.\n\nThis is the beauty of our Goldturn channels, which we draw in our unique way, using averages rather than price. This enables us to identify fake-outs and breakouts clearly, as minimal noise in the way our channels are drawn.\n\nWe will use our smaller timeframe analysis on the 1H and 4H chart to buy dips from the weighted Goldturns for 30 to 40 pips clean. Ranging markets are perfectly suited for this type of trading, instead of trying to hold longer positions and getting chopped up in the swings up and down in the range.\n\nWe will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch bounces up using our smaller timeframe ideas.\n\nOur long term bias is Bullish and therefore we look forward to drops from rejections, which allows us to continue to use our smaller timeframes to buy dips using our levels and setups.\n\nBuying dips allows us to safely manage any swings rather then chasing the bull from the top.\n\nThank you all for your likes, comments and follows, we really appreciate it!\n\nMr Gold\nGoldViewFX",

A 5 EMA lock would further confirm this move.\n\nIf instead we see a rejection at this level with a close below 4507, this would open 4406. A further close below 4406 would expose the channel half-line, which is a stronger primary support level where a bounce is more likely. Only a decisive break below the channel half-line would open the larger swing range, aligning with the channel floor\n\nThis is the beauty of our Goldturn channels, which we draw in our unique way, using averages rather than price.

    "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nPlease see our updated 1h chart levels and targets for the coming week.\n\nWe are seeing price play between two weighted levels with a gap above at 4100 and a gap below at 4057. We will need to see ema5 cross and lock on either weighted level to determine the next range.\n\nWe will see levels tested side by side until one of the weighted levels break and lock to confirm direction for the next range.\n\nWe will keep the above in mind when taking buys from dips. Our updated levels and weighted levels will allow us to track the movement down and then catch bounces up.\n\nWe will continue to buy dips using our support levels taking 20 to 40 pips. As stated before each of our level structures give 20 to 40 pip bounces, which is enough for a nice entry and exit. If you back test the levels we shared every week for the past 24 months, you can see how effectively they were used to trade with or against short/mid term swings and trends.\n\nThe swing range give bigger bounces then our weighted levels that's the difference between weighted levels and swing ranges.\n\nBULLISH TARGET\n4100\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 4100 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGETS\n4140\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 4140 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET\n4193\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 4193 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET\n4233\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 4233 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BULLISH TARGET\n4275\n\nBEARISH TARGETS\n4057\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 4057 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BEARISH TARGET\n4016\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 4016 WILL OPEN THE FOLLOWING BEARISH TARGET\n3965\n\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 3965 WILL OPEN THE SWING RANGE\n3923\n3861\n\nAs always, we will keep you all updated with regular updates throughout the week and how we manage the active ideas and setups. Thank you all for your likes, comments and follows, we really appreciate it!\n\nMr Gold\nGoldViewFX",
